/*Things to be aware of :
  * HTTP content type header should be set as follows:
    * Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
    * application/json is accepted, but it's incorrect way
  
  * Console tool will handle this anyway
    * But when using HTTP clients (curl), we need to handle this ourselves
  
  * Each line must end with a new line char ( \n or \r\n)
    * Including the last line (last line shouljd be empty)
    
  * A failed action will not affect other actions ( that's why BULK api returns detailed info about each action)
